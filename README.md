# JHax-TextQuest
Open Source repository for my first attempts at making games. 

I made these back in 2012 as a bit of fun when I was first learning to code. Mostly putting them here so I don't end up losing the code somewhere forever.
Please excuse the code quality and the content's general clumsiness.
